The problem of predicting a user's star rating for a product, given the user's text review for that product, is called Review Rating Prediction and has lately become a popular, problem in machine learning. In this project, we implement an approach which involves a combination of topic modeling and sentiment analysis to achieve this objective by treating Review Rating Prediction as a multi-class classification problem, and building different prediction models by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation as the underlying feature extraction method with three machine learning algorithms, (i) K Nearest Neighbors, (ii) Multinomial Naive Bayes and (iii) Random Forest. We analyze the performance of each of these models to come up with the best model for predicting the ratings from reviews. We use the dataset provided by Yelp for training and testing the models.
